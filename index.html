PICoL is launching fall 2024. It is directed by Ethan G. Wilcox, and housed in the Linguistics Department. Our mission is to understand the computational mechanisms that facilitate language learning and language processing in the human mind and to use this knowledge to build robust, safe, and inclusive language technologies. To accomplish these goals, we deploy a multidisciplinary toolkit including theories from formal linguistics, experimental psycholinguistics, statistical modeling, and deep learning methods. For more information, <a href="wilcoxeg.github.io"> please see Ethan's personal webpage. </a> <br> <br>

&#129476; &#129476; The lab website is currently under construction. Please check back later! &#129476; &#129476; <br>
