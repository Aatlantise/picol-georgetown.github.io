ðŸ¥’ PICoL (pronounced "pickle") at Georgetown ðŸ¥’

PICoL, launched fall 2024, is directed by [Ethan G. Wilcox](https://wilcoxeg.github.io/).
Housed in the Linguistics Department, our mission is to understand the computational mechanisms that
facilitate language learning and language processing
in the human mind and to use this knowledge to build robust, safe, and inclusive language technologies.
To accomplish these goals, we deploy a multidisciplinary toolkit including theories from formal linguistics,
experimental psycholinguistics, statistical modeling, and deep learning methods.
